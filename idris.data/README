using idris | haskell to do things I would normally do from bash.

is it better?

maybe (co)monads will be easier with practical examples.






.hs files use main :: IO()

in .idr this would be main : IO ()



Idris is still a cabal-install from haskell, so `:set syntax=haskell` will look OK for .idr (in vim).




I have The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.4.3 and idris --version 1.3.1.


I assume you have a data file to play with. If not, use city crime data csv.
